Notes for test authors

- The scaffold can record a manifest of created files when invoked with `--record-manifest /path/to/manifest`.
  Each manifest line is written as a tab-separated pair: `<absolute-path>\t<sha256>` (sha256 may be empty on some
  platforms). Test harnesses can pass that manifest to a cleanup helper to remove only the files the scaffold created.
